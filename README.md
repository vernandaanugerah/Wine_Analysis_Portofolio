# Wine_Analysis_Portofolio

## Data Cleaning 








## Possible Analysis 

1.  Which province has the highest average price? How about of those with at least 10 wines? Use SQL

2.  Does the number of points predict the price of the wine? If so, how strong is the correlation? Use Python or XL MINER

3.  Dig into reviewer-level trends. Do reviewers tend to specialize in one or two provinces? Do they specialize in certain varieties?

4.  Dig into the 'description' column. What are some of the most common terms used in positive reviews? Negative reviews? probably python
